90%时间，无法专注，feel uncomfortable then turn to do other things like running Taichi， wechat

wechat占用太多时间，帮助yan，和碧磊聊天等等，可以抽个专门的时间看微信。

跟自己打坐时一模一样。

看来很有必要训练定力，然后代入到生活中。











不好意思拒绝。

碧磊电话







##需要写第三人称介绍

给linkedin haoyu wang

给爽哥

没有完成目标，是因为不专注和精力不足。

在看游戏直播上花了1-2个小时

wechat上2-3个小时，

电话10min

还是没找到眼睛 /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~



断网比较好！

当前情况

优点

想







分布式系统





NoSQL vs SQL

单维度查询 vs 多维度查询

高consistensy的时候需要SQL



从最简单出发，

最少的数据出发，方便想象最简单的使用场景，最简单的Senario

写几个函数，功能大概是你什么。不用在意传输协议REST之类，提到传输。

Bottleneck



一台超级计算机vs多态计算机

reliability 高于     多台，因为这里分布式其实也有bottle neck的地方，比如有状态依赖的地方 stateful

速度更快

成本太高



message queue

几大作用，

全部是连接到queue。queue维护ip地址，上线状态，解耦：不同通信协议

一开始是为了解决服务器之间的通信问题





对于高一致性的，尽量始终用一台服务器。



Master slave数据库备份方式，slave可以用于读，只有master负责写。
